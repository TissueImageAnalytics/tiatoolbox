    "## About this notebook\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory or Kaggle. (The Kaggle version is temporarily unavailable.) To connect with Colab or Kaggle, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" appears in the browser address bar after you click on \"Open in Colab\". Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on either Github or colab, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook.\n",

    "## Why normalise colour?\n",
    "Pathologists usually find it easy to ignore features of a whole slide image (WSI) that are irrelevant from the point of view of diagnosis and treatment. However, this is not the case for computers. A standard hazard in digital pathology is that a computer program, developed using WSIs from one centre, gives much less impressive results when tried on WSIs from another centre. There are many factors contributing to such problems, among which are differences in colouring of WSIs from two different centres, even when the same standardised staining protocols are in force. These differences can be due to variation in slide scanners, the experience and skill of technicians, the quality and concentration of antigens, incubation time and temperature, *etc, etc*. Ideally, the same tissue specimens, stained in different laboratories, should give the same results, but this ideal appears to be unreachable. Stain normalisation is a common pre-processing step, whose objective is to reduce to a minimum colour differences that have no significance in clinical practice. `tiatoolbox` makes a few different stain-normalisation algorithms available to the user, and we demonstrate how to use them in this notebook."
