# # Introduction
# 
# This notebook is aimed at advanced users who are interersted in using
# TIAToolbox as part of an experiment or larger project. Here we replicate
# the method in "SlideGraph+: Whole Slide Image Level Graphs
# to Predict HER2Status in Breast Cancer" by Liu et al. (2020) to generate
# a graph and predict a slide level label. Our task
# is to classify if a whole slide image (WSI) is
# [HER2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HER2/neu) negative or positive.
# To do this, we will use the
# [TCGA-BRCA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA) dataset.
# 
# Throughout this notebook we use modules from TIAToolbox to assist with
# common tasks including:
# - Patch extraction
# - Stain normalization
# - Cell segmentation & classification
# - Extraction of deep features

#  ## Loading The Dataset
# 
# For this dataset (TCGA-BRCA), the HER2 status is provided per patient
#  instead of per slide. Therefor, we assign the same label to all WSIs coming from the same patient. Additionally, WSIs that do not have labels are excluded from subsequent processing.
# 
#  We begin this notebook with loading the data by doing the following:
#  1. Load a list of WSIs and associated tissue masks (file paths).
#  2. Convert the clinical infomation in `.csv` to labels.
#  3. Assign the patient label to each WSI
#  4. Filter out WSIs which do not have a label.
# 
#  We use the following global variables:
#  - `CLINICAL_FILE`: The `.csv` file which contains the patient code and
#    the associated labels.
#  - `ROOT_OUTPUT_DIR`: Root directory to save output under.
#  - `WSI_DIR`: Directory contains WSIs.
#  - `MSK_DIR`: Directory containing the corresponding WSI mask. If set to `None`,
#    the subsequent process will use the default method in the toolbox to obtain
#    the mask (via `WSIReader.tissue_mask`). Each mask file is assumed to be `.png`
#    and any non-zero pixels within it are considered for the processing.
# 
#  By the end of this process, we obtain following variables for subsequent
#  operations
#  - `wsi_paths`: A list of file paths to WSIs.
#  - `wsi_names`: A list of WSI names in `wsi_paths`.
#  - `msk_paths`: A list of paths pointing to masks of each
#    WSI in `wsi_paths`.
#  - `label_df`: A panda dataframe containing two columns: `WSI-CODE` and "LABEL". Each row in the dataframe is a pair, whose    first entry is the name of a WSI in the list `wsi_names` and whose second entry is the label of that WSI.

# ## Generate the Data Split
# 
# Now, we split our dataaset into disjoint train, validation, and test subsets.
# 
# To that end, we define a new function called `stratified_split`.
# It receives:
# 
# - paired input of the samples and their labels
# - the train, valid, and test percentages
# 
# and then returns a number of stratified splits.
# 
# **Stratification** means that, for each label, the proportion of samples with that label is as similar as possible in each of the three split. Stratification ensures that any bias that might result from a particular label operates as equally as possible in each split. This is a standard way of avoiding bias due to possible confounding factors â€“ here each label is regarded as a possible confounding factor.

# # Generating Graphs from WSIs
#  
# Now that we have definef our sources of data, we move on to transforming
# them into a more usable form. We represent each WSI as a graph. Each node
# in the graph corresponds to one patch within the WSI and is then
# represented by a set of features. Here, we show using two different
# feature representations:
# 
# - Deep Neural Network features: obtained from the global average
#   pooling layer after we apply ResNet50 on the patch.
# - Cellular composition: where we count the number of nuclei of each type within
#   the patch.
# 
# With these node-level representations (or features), we then perform clustering
# so that nodes that are close to each other both in feature space and in the 2D
# space (i.e the WSI canvas) are assigned to the same cluster. These clusters are
# then linked to other clusters within a certain distance, thus making up a WSI graph.
# 
# **Note**: Features of patches and theirs positions within each WSI
# will be stored separately in files named `*.features.npy` and `*.position.npy` .
# The `position` of a feature is, by definition, the patch bounding box
# `(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)` at the highest resolution.
# Subsequent function definitions will be based upon this convention.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Deep Feature Extraction
# 
# We now show how to use the toolbox to extract features. We package
# it into a small function called `extract_deep_features` for better organization.
# 
# In this function, we define the config object which defines the shape and magnification of the
# patch we want to extract. Although the patches are allowed to have arbitrary size and differing
# resolutions, here we use a patch of size 512x512 with 0.25 microns-per-pixel (`mpp=0.25`).
# We use ResNet50 trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor. For more
# detail on how to further customize this, you can refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox/blob/develop/examples/07_example_modeltechniques.ipynb).
# 
# We explain how to construct a customized preprocessing function that we would like
# the `engine` to perform on each input patch. For this notebook, we perform stain-normalization
# on each image patch. We show how this function can be defined later. (`engine`
# is a set of classes defined under `tiatoolbox.models.engine`. Each instance of these classes has
# multiple properties and abilities, possibly incorporating several functions.)
# 
# By default, the names of output files from the toolbox are
# changed to sequentially ordered names (000.*.npy, 001.*.npy, etc.) to avoid
# inadvertent overwriting. A mapping from output path name to input path name is returned by the engine,
# making the name change easy to manage.
# 
# In this demo, we use a toolbox model with only one head (output channel).
# For each input, we will have `*.position.npy` and `*.features.0.npy`.
# In the case of models having multiple output heads (output channels), the output is
# `['*.position.npy', '*.features.0.npy', '*.features.1.npy', etc.]` . The positions are always
# defined as the patch bounding box `(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)` at the highest resolution
# within the list of input resolutions. Refer to the [semantic segmentation notebook](https://github.com/TissueImageAnalytics/tiatoolbox/blob/develop/examples/06_example_semanticsegmentation.ipynb)
# for details.

# ## Cell Composition Extraction
# 
# In a similar manner, we define the code to extract cell
# composition in `extract_composition_features`. First, we need to
# detect all nuclei in the WSI and their types. This can be
# easily achieved via the `tiatoolbox.models.NucleusInstanceSegmentor`
# engine and the HoVer-Net pretrained model, both provided in the toolbox.
# Once we have the nuclei, we split the WSI into patches
# and count the nuclei of each type in each patch.
# We encapsulate this process in the function `get_composition_features`.
# 
# Unlike the `FeatureExtractor` above, engine from `NucleusInstanceSegmentor`
# returns a single output file given a single WSI input. Their corresponding
# output files are named as `['*/0.dat', '*/1.dat', etc.]` and we will also
# need to rename them accordingly. We further generate the cell composition
# features from each of these files and saved under `*.features.npy` and
# `*.position.npy` respectively.

# Above, we have already defined functions that can perform WSI feature extraction.
# Now we perform the extraction itself. We avoid computationally expensive re-extraction
# of WSI features. We differentiate two use cases via the the `CACHE_PATH` variable;
# if `CACHE_PATH = None`, then extraction is performed and the results are saved
# in `WSI_FEATURE_DIR`. For ease of organization, we set by default
# `WSI_FEATURE_DIR = f'{ROOT_OUTPUT_DIR}/features/'`. Otherwise, the paths
# to feature files are queried. On the other hand, there is the `FEATURE_MODE` variable
# that dictates which patch features will be extracted. Here, we support
# - `"cnn"` : for the deep neural network features.
# - `"composition"` : for the cell composition features.
# 
# We use an assertion check at the end to ensure that we have
# the same number of output files as samples.

# At the time of writing this, graph datasets were not yet supported by TIAToolbox. We therefore defined here their
# loading and IO conversion. The goal of this dataset class is to support loading the input concurrently, and seperately from the running GPU process. The class performs data conversion and other preprocessing if necessary. The `preproc` argument below is available to specify the function that normalizes node features.

# ## Batch Sampler
# 
# Now that we have ensured that the model can run, letâ€™s take a step back and look at
# the model definition again, in preparation for training and inference handling. 
# 
# The `infer_batch` is straightforward here: it handles inferencing of the input batch
# data and organizes the output content. Likewise, `train_batch` defines training, such as
# calculating the loss and so on. The loss defined here is not straightforward or standardized
# like cross-entropy. There is a pitfall lurking in the above code that could crash the training.
# Consider the lines:
# 
# ```python
# wsi_labels_ = wsi_labels[:, None]
# wsi_labels_ = wsi_labels_ - wsi_labels_.T
# wsi_output_ = wsi_output - wsi_output.T
# diff = wsi_output_[wsi_labels_ > 0]
# loss = torch.mean(F.relu(1.0 - diff))
# ```
# 
# Specifically, we need to take care of `diff = wsi_output_[wsi_labels_ > 0]` where
# we want to calculate the loss using pairs only positive samples. When a batch contains
# no positive samples at all, especially for a skewed dataset, there will no samples to
# calculate the loss and we will have `NaN` loss. To resolve this, we define a sampler
# specifically for the training process, such that its resulting batch always contains
# positive samples.

# ## The Training Loop
# 
# Training and running a neural network at the current time involves plugging
# several parts together so that they work in tandem. In simplified terms, training
# consists of the following steps:
# 
# 1. Define a network object (`torch.nn.module`) for a particular architecture.
# 2. Define a loader object to handle loading data concurrently.
# 3. Define an optimizer(s) and scheduler to update the network weights.
# 4. Callback functions for several stages (starting of epoch, end of step, etc.)
#    to aggregate results, save the models, refresh data, and much more.
# 
# For inference, #3 is not necessary.
# 
# At the moment, the wiring of these operations is handled mostly in the toolbox via various `engine`.

# ### Defining The Loop
# 
# Finally, we define the function to manage the running loop, or the simplified
# engine so to speak. The running loop contains of several important events
# that require special definition and handling of the dataset, the model, etc.
# 
# - **EPOCH_START**: The start of each epoch. Depending on the task, it may be
#   necessary to clean up and refresh the data accumulated over the previous epoch
#   (such as clearing previous validation results).
# - **STEP_START**: The start of each step. The loader is asked for data. The data
#   is passed on and training or model inference step is triggered.
# - **STEP_STOP**: The end of each step. The loss is computed, console output is logged,
#   and the training or inference results are collated.
# - **EPOCH_COMPLETE**: The end of each epoch. This often involves saving the model,
#   or in our case, starting the training of the Platt Scaler.
# 
# Often, each of these events can have their own set of callbacks that will be invoked.
# Furthermore, these callbacks may also vary across dataset or running mode (such as
# metric calculations, saving mode, etc.). As this is a simplified version,
# we include all handling of these within `run_once`. However, in practice, they are
# usually factored out into a set of classes and hooks.
# 
# The `run_once` function is provided with a dictionary of datasets.
# Within this dictionary, `train` is the dataset used for training which
# includes the sampler which ensures a positive sample in each batch.
# Additionally, `*infer-valid*` and `*infer-train*` are the datasets used for
# validation of the model and training of the Platt scaling respectively.
# These two datasets do not make use of the sampler which ensures a positive
# sample in each batch. Any other dataset in the dictionary which
# matches the pattern `*infer*` is assumed to be used for testing.

# a set of parameters:

# - `MODEL_DIR`: the location where we save the model weights
#   every epoch and associated information. Under it, we have
#   - `epoch=[X].weights.pth`: the graph neural network weights after
#     the X-th training epoch.
#   - `epoch=[X].weights.aux.dat`: the associated sklearn model trained
#     for the X-th epoch. In our case, it contains the Platt Scaling.
#   - `stats.json`: the file contains accumulated statistic of the entire
#     training run for the X-th epoch.
#   - `stats.old.json`: the backup file of `stats.json` of the previous epoch.
# - `NUM_EPOCHS`: the number of epoch for training.
# 
# Additionally, to avoid accidentally over-writing training results, we will
# skip the training if the `MODEL_DIR` already exists.
