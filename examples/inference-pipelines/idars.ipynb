    "------------------------------------\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no prior installation of any programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory or Kaggle. To connect with Colab or Kaggle, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" or \"kaggle\", as appropriate, appears in the address bar. If the left click does not work, you can right-click on the blue checkbox \"[Colab]\" above and select \"Open in new tab\". Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on Github, Colab or Kaggle, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook.\n",

Here, representative tiles from each WSI are iteratively sampled, explaining the name IDaRS.
