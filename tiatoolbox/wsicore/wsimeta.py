"""This module defines a dataclass which holds metadata about a WSI.

With this class, metadata is in a normalised consistent format
which is quite useful when working with many different WSI formats.
The raw metadata is also preserved and accessible via a dictionary. The
format of this dictionary may vary between WSI formats.

class WSIMeta:
    """Whole slide image metadata class.

    Args:
            slide_dimensions (int, int): Tuple containing the width and
                height of the WSI. These are for the baseline (full resolution)
                image if the WSI is a pyramid or multi-resoltion.
            level_dimensions (list): A list of dimensions for each level of the
                pyramid or for each resolution in the WSI.
            objective_power (float, optional): The power of the objective lens
                used to create the image.
            level_count: (int, optional): The number of levels or resolutions
                in the WSI. If not given this is assigned
                len(level_dimensions). Defaults to None.
            level_downsamples (:obj:`list` of :obj:`float`): List of scale
                values which describe how many times smaller the current level
                is compared with the baseline.
            vendor (str, optional): Scanner vendor/manufacturer description.
            mpp (float, float, optional): Microns per pixel.
            file_path (Path, optional): Path to the corresponding WSI file.
            raw (dict, optional): Dictionary of unprocessed metadata extracted
                from the WSI format. For JPEG-2000 images this contains an xml
                object under the key "xml".

    Attributes:
        slide_dimensions (tuple(int)): Tuple containing the width and
            height of the WSI. These are for the baseline (full resolution)
            image if the WSI is a pyramid or multi-resoltion. Required.
        level_dimensions (list): A list of dimensions for each level of the
            pyramid or for each resolution in the WSI. Defaults to
            [slide_dimension].
        objective_power (float): The magnification power of the objective lens
            used to scan the image. Not always present or accurate.
            Defaults to None.
        level_count: (int): The number of levels or resolutions
            in the WSI. If not given this is assigned
            len(level_dimensions). Defaults to len(level_dimensions).
        level_downsamples (:obj:`list` of :obj:`float`): List of scale
            values which describe how many times smaller the current level
            is compared with the baseline. Defaults to (1,).
        vendor (str): Scanner vendor/manufacturer description.
        mpp (float, float, optional): Microns per pixel. Derived from objective
            power and sensor size. Not always present or accurate.
            Defaults to None.
        file_path (Path): Path to the corresponding WSI file. Defaults to None.
        raw (dict): Dictionary of unprocessed metadata extracted
            from the WSI format. For JP2 images this contains an xml object
            under the key "xml". Defaults to empty dictionary.
