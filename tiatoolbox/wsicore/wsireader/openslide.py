        Location is in terms of the baseline image (level 0  / maximum
        resolution), and size is the output image size.

        Reads can be performed at different resolutions by supplying a
        pair of arguments for the resolution and the units of
        resolution. If metadata does not specify `mpp` or
        `objective_power` then `baseline` units should be selected with
        resolution 1.0

        The field of view varies with resolution. For a fixed field of
        view see :func:`read_bounds`.

        Args:
            location (IntPair):
                (x, y) tuple giving the top left pixel in the baseline
                (level 0) reference frame.
            size (IntPair):
                (width, height) tuple giving the desired output image
                size.
            resolution (Resolution):
                Resolution at which to read the image, default = 0.
                Either a single number or a sequence of two numbers for
                x and y are valid. This value is in terms of the
                corresponding units. For example: resolution=0.5 and
                units="mpp" will read the slide at 0.5 microns
                per-pixel, and resolution=3, units="level" will read at
                level at pyramid level / resolution layer 3.
            units (Units):
                The units of resolution, default = "level". Supported
                units are: microns per pixel (mpp), objective power
                (power), pyramid / resolution level (level), pixels per
                baseline pixel (baseline).
            interpolation (str):
                Method to use when resampling the output image. Possible
                values are "linear", "cubic", "lanczos", "area", and
                "optimise". Defaults to 'optimise' which will use cubic
                interpolation for upscaling and area interpolation for
                downscaling to avoid moiré patterns.
            pad_mode (str):
                Method to use when padding at the edges of the image.
                Defaults to 'constant'. See :func:`numpy.pad` for
                available modes.
            pad_constant_values (int, tuple(int)):
                Constant values to use when padding with constant pad mode.
                Passed to the :func:`numpy.pad` `constant_values` argument.
                Default is 0.
            coord_space (str):
                Defaults to "baseline". This is a flag to indicate if
                the input `bounds` is in the baseline coordinate system
                ("baseline") or is in the requested resolution system
                ("resolution").

                Extra key-word arguments for reader specific parameters.
                Currently only used by VirtualWSIReader. See class

        Returns:
            :class:`numpy.ndarray`:
                Array of size MxNx3 M=size[0], N=size[1]

        Example:
            >>> from tiatoolbox.wsicore.wsireader import WSIReader
            >>> # Load a WSI image
            >>> wsi = WSIReader.open(input_img="./CMU-1.ndpi")

            >>> # Read a region at level 0 (baseline / full resolution)
            >>> img = wsi.read_rect(location, size)
            >>> # Read a region at 0.5 microns per pixel (mpp)
            >>> img = wsi.read_rect(location, size, 0.5, "mpp")
            >>> # This could also be written more verbosely as follows
            >>> img = wsi.read_rect(
            ...     location,
            ...     size,
            ...     resolution=(0.5, 0.5),
            ...     units="mpp",
            ... )

        Note: The field of view varies with resolution when using
        :func:`read_rect`.

            :width: 512
            :alt: Diagram illustrating read_rect

        As the location is in the baseline reference frame but the size
        (width and height) is the output image size, the field of view
        therefore changes as resolution changes.

        If the WSI does not have a resolution layer corresponding
        exactly to the requested resolution (shown above in white with a
        dashed outline), a larger resolution is downscaled to achieve
        the correct requested output resolution.

        If the requested resolution is higher than the baseline (maximum
        resultion of the image), then bicubic interpolation is applied
        to the output image.

            :width: 512
            :alt: Diagram illustrating read_rect interpolting between levels

        When reading between the levels stored in the WSI, the
        coordinates of the requested region are projected to the next
        highest resolution. This resolution is then decoded and
        downsampled to produce the desired output. This is a major
        source of variability in the time take to perform a read
        operation. Reads which require reading a large region before
        downsampling will be significantly slower than reading at a
        fixed level.

            >>> from tiatoolbox.wsicore.wsireader import WSIReader
            >>> # Load a WSI image

            ...     units="mpp",
            ... )
            >>> # Several units can be used including: objective power,
            >>> # microns per pixel, pyramid/resolution level, and
